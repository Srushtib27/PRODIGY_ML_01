# PRODIGY_ML_01
This project uses linear regression to predict house prices based on square footage, number of bedrooms, and number of bathrooms. 
It is implemented in Python and uses libraries like NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Scikit-learn. The dataset should include columns for these features and the target price. After installing the required libraries and adding the dataset, the script can be run to train the model and evaluate its performance using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and R-squared Score (RÂ²).
